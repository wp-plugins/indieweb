= What are WebMentions? =

[WebMention](http://webmention.org) is a simple way to automatically notify any URL when you link to it on your site. From the receivers perpective, it's a way to request notification when other sites link to it.

Itâ€™s a modern alternative to Pingback and other forms of Linkback.
